# PiOLED

OLED breakout for a Raspberry Pi. The design was made with all through hole components for easy assembly by most users. Open source applications were used to create this controller. [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/) was used for the PCB design, and [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) for the documentation.

To order your own PCB upload the gerber.zip file to your favorite PCB manufacture of choice, I personally use [jlcpcb.com](https://jlcpcb.com/).

### Features
* OLED Display header
* 2 pin GPIO Header for Push Button or Relay Support
* 5v Header
