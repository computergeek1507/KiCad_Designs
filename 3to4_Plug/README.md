# 3 to 4 Adapter

Adapter to use Falcon v3 Expansions with the Falcon v4 Controllers. Open source applications were used to create this controller. [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/) was used for the PCB design, and [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) for the documentation.

To order your own PCB upload the gerber.zip file to your favorite PCB manufacture of choice, I personally use [jlcpcb.com](https://jlcpcb.com/).
