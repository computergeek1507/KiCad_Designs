# Weather Wemos

Breakout board for the Wemos D1 Mini to use it with the [Sparkfun Weather Meter Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15901). The design was made with all through hole components for easy assembly by most users. Open source applications were used to create this controller. [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/) was used for the PCB design, and [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) for the documentation.

To order your own PCB upload the gerber.zip file to your favorite PCB manufacture of choice, I personally use [jlcpcb.com](https://jlcpcb.com/).
